<li>Unique Share Links: Once a file is uploaded, a unique shareable link is generated, enabling users to share and download files easily.</li>
Responsive Design: The UI is responsive across devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile.
<h1>Techniques and Tools:</h1>
<li>React.js: For building a dynamic, component-driven UI.</li>
<li>React-Dropzone: For a flexible and intuitive file upload experience.</li>
